## üìå Programs Included

1. **Prime Number Check**
   - Checks whether a given number is prime or not.
   - Example:
     ```
     Input: 29
     Output: 29 is a Prime Number.
     ```

2. **Even or Odd Check**
   - Determines whether a number is even or odd.
   - Example:
     ```
     Input: 10
     Output: 10 is Even.
     ```

3. **Fibonacci Series**
   - Prints the Fibonacci series up to `n` terms.
   - Example:
     ```
     Input: 10
     Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34
     ```

4. **Factorial Program**
   - Finds factorial of a given number using loop.
   - Example:
     ```
     Input: 5
     Output: 120
     ```
     
5. **Palindrome Number**
   - Checks whether a given number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).
   - Example:
     ```
     Input: 121
     Output: 121 is a Palindrome.

     Input: 123
     Output: 123 is NOT a Palindrome.
